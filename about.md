Open Design Kit is a living collection of guides and best practices to help you to make and design openly.

The Kit was originally incubated at [Bocoup](https://bocoup.com/) and became a community-owned project in Summer 2017. In 2020, the community gave it's blessing to the Wikimedia Foundation to take over stewardship of the project.

Design at [Wikimedia](https://design.wikimedia.org/) means making sharing of all human knowledge easy and joyful. For everyone. Designing in the open with a transparent and participatory process, the Wikimedia Foundation collaborates with product teams and with the global community of contributors to create well-designed solutions, together.

Please help us make it better by contributing to it. Open Design Kit is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.
